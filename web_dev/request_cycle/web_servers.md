#Release 1 

#Linux

* Free and open-source.
* Unix-based
* Designed to be fast, efficient and minimalist.
* Recent Linux development has also been focused on standardization, since Unix code written for one 
  implementation may not run correctly on another.
* Based on 3 main bodies of code: The kernal, the system libraries and the system utilities.

#VPS

* A virtual private server is a service sold by internet hosting services that essentially provides the 
  customer with access to a remote computer running their own a instance of an operating system that has
  full administrator access.  They are actually a single server partitioned to act as many.  It aims to provide functionality equivalent of that of having one's own dedicated physical server.

* Advantages of using a VPS include:
	- They are cheaper and more efficient to maintain.
	- They provide a fast means of backup for disaster recovery, or can be used as a safe remote environment
	  compartmentalized from local computers.
	- They are fast to get up and running.

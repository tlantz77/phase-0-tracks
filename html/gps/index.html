<!--
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

Semantic tags add thematic meaning to the content within.  A non-sematic tag like "div" doesn't tell you anything about its content, while semantic tags define their content.  "Article" for example can be used for a newspaper article or blog post.  "Section" seems useful for a broad range of content, whereas "header", "footer" and "aside" seem pretty necessary for making an attractive modern webpage.


What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

Generally it will default to top-to-bottom unless you format the various elements to appear side-to-side or otherwise.


What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

I certainly did not know about snippets beforehand and they seem really useful.  I'd like to make snippets for tables, lists and other work-intensive page elements that should hopefully cut down on a lot of the busy work.



What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can your understanding of this concept?

Creating the snippet was tricky at first since I was unfamiliar with them.  It seems like the best way to learn them is simply to go nuts experimenting with them.

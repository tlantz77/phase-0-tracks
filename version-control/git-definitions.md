# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows programmers to make checkpoints for changes in code and essentially have a navigable history of backups for code.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

To keep work-in-progress code isolated from the main codebase until it is ready to be merged.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a confirmation of a change to code that creates a save point that one can come back to later.  A good commit message is simply a clear, consise statement that explains what changes were made.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically figure out how to merge files, for example when 2 different people make different edits to the same line in the same piece of code.
